# You are developing a program that performs a division operation on two numbers provided by the user. 
# However, there is a situation where a runtime error can occur due to a division by zero. 
#To help junior developers learn about error handling in expressions and conditions, 
# you want to create a program deliberately containing this error and guide them in diagnosing and fixing it.

def division(n1, n2):    # Function Declaration Where function name is division and n1, n2 are function parameters
        n = n1/n2      # Division formula and storing result in a variable "n"
        print(n)       # Printing the result 
x1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))    # getting input for number 1 from the user and storing it in a variable x1 
x2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))   # getting input for number 2  from the user and storing it in a variable x2 
division(x1,x2)              # Passing x1 , x2 as arguments to function call
